	    The survey data will be used as part of a paper discussing lockscreen security by Gareth Knowles at the University of Bristol.\n
	    With the emergence of mobile devices into mainstream usage, 
	    the importance of the security of data and applications stored on the device has become increasingly important.
	    The first and often last line of defence against attacks on the device data is a user authentication lock screen.\n
	    This survey is created as part of research into user lockscreen security habits.\n
	    All data is sent securely and anonymously to the server with no ability to trace data back to you or your device.\n
	    All data will be held for a maximum of six months and will only be used by Gareth Knowles and researchers at the University of Bristol.\n
